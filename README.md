## üìç Overview

This Python-based Static Site Generator (SSG) offers a comprehensive solution for creating fully-featured websites from Markdown content. Our tool not only transforms your Markdown files into browser-ready HTML but also seamlessly integrates static assets like images and CSS, resulting in a complete and polished web presence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: Effortlessly transform your Markdown content into valid HTML pages.
- **Static Asset Integration**: Easily include images, CSS files, and other static resources in your generated sites.
- **Flexible Template System**: Utilize customizable templates for consistent page layouts across your site.
- **Placeholder Support**: Employ reusable components within your templates, similar to modern frontend frameworks.
- **Customization**: Out-of-the-box support for {{Title}} and {{Content}} placeholders, with the ability to add more through the main script.

Our SSG streamlines the process of building static websites by combining the simplicity of Markdown writing with the power of HTML templates and the richness of static assets. This approach allows content creators, developers, and designers to focus on their work while ensuring a professional and visually appealing result.

Whether you're creating a personal blog, a project documentation site, or a small business website, this tool provides the flexibility and features needed to bring your vision to life. From text content to stylesheets and images, everything is neatly organized and optimized for web delivery.
